* trying to get images to load. It looks like when I load images that they are seen as html in the network tab of devtools in browser
* this doesn't happen when i try to load same image in standard nonreact phaser project.
* i added an issue to the github where we are getting this library to embed a phaser canvas into react component because it might be due to that
